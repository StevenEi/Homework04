04 Code Quiz Game

## Project Description
For this project I had to create a timed code quiz that offered the player multiple possible answers to posed questions. The player then had their score increased for each question they answered correctly and their remaining time reduced for each incorrect answer. At the end of the game their score would be retained in local storage so they could come back and beat their previous high score. 

## What I Learned
I learned a lot from this project. I spent multiple hours struggling with how to put all the pieces together because this has definitely been the most in depth homework so far. I learned a lot about making and interacting with timers, creating a variable that is an array of objects and writing functions that are called when different criteria are met (e.g. firing when all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0 seconds). I will need to practice all of the concepts required to do this project because I definitely could not have done it without the help of my instructor Tom McCarthy.

## Difficulties that I had
I had a lot of difficulty writing the checkAnswers function because of how many different variables and functions it utilizes. Once Tom helped me figure out the event.target syntax it became a lot easier and I imagine I will be using that technique frequently in the future. I also had some issues with setting and getting the score into and out of local storage mainly because I forgot about the JSON stringify and JSON parse methods.
